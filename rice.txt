INSTRUCTIONS
 
Traditional Method: Soaking Dry Black Beans
In a large pot, add 6 ounces of dry black beans with 3 cups of water (save the remaining 5 cups for tomorrow). Cover and soak overnight.
The next day, drain the beans and then add 5 new cups of water to the pot. Bring to a boil and cook them for 60 minutes, stirring frequently.
Be careful not to let the beans dry out completely. You can add 1 cup of water if they are absorbing the water too quickly. Keep an eye on them. You can remove a few beans from the pot and squish them with the back of a spoon to make sure they have softened.
After softening the beans for 60 minutes, transfer them to a bowl with 1 1/2 cups of its cooking liquid. Set aside.
In a Dutch oven, add bacon slices and fry until fully cooked and crispy. Do not discard the bacon fat. Transfer the bacon slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Roughly chop them. Set aside.
In the same Dutch oven with the bacon fat, add green peppers and onions. Saut√© for about 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
Add rice, softened black beans with 1 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid from softening the beans, ground cumin, dried oregano, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Cover, reduce heat to simmer, and cook for 30 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE LID. The steam is what cooks the rice.
After 30 minutes, remove the lid and give it a big stir so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook for another 5-10 minutes until the rice is fluffy and cooked.
Remove from heat but keep the lid on for another 5-10 minutes. Fluff with a fork then stir in the chopped bacon. Serve and enjoy!
